There are 4 code files, with the main code being in "source_code.py". The "kruskal_class" file contains code 
for the Kruskal algorithm, "dijkshitra_class" for Dijkshitra algorithm, and "SCC_class" for calculating strongly connected components.

In total, 9 input files were used, with files 0-4 being directed graphs and files 5-8 being undirected. 
The Dijkshitra algorithm was used for all 9 input files, while Kruskal's algorithm was only used for the undirected graphs.
The calculation of strongly connected components was performed for all 9 input graphs.

Run "source_Code.py" to see the output.
